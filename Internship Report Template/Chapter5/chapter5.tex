In this internship report, we have presented the work on the modification of the PhoGPT-4B-Chat model to reduce the model size while not significantly affecting the model's performance. The experiments are conducted by removing different numbers and positions of layers from the model and evaluating the model's performance using the perplexity metric on the test prompt dataset. The results show that the trade-off between model size and performance, as well as the inference speed. The results also show one important feature of the model: the first and last layers have much more significant impact on the model's performance compared to the middle layers. \par
