\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Ta Viet Cuong, for his guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the internship. His valuable advices and feedbacks have helped me a lot in completing the research and experiments. \par
I would also like to the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Engineering and Technology, VNU, and HMI lab for providing me with the opportunity to participate in the summer internship program. \par
Without the support, I would not have been able to complete the internship and this report. \par
